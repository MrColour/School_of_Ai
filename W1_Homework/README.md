OpenAi CartPole

This was made so that I could get an understanding of OpenAi's gym.
Hopefully it helps others see what is happening.

There are two files. Versions are denoted by v1, v2.

Version one is a very basic file with lots of comments explaining what is happening in terms of gym. Since I
didn't copy and paste it in but wrote it, it might not work but it should be pretty close. Maybe a few syntax mistakes or something.
If you are just starting this might be a good file to play around with and test things out. If version one doesn't work try version two 
since that one should work. If both version one and version two don't work then something has gone astray in your installation of gym,
python or something...

Version two is the more complete setup with a settings dictonary which you can adjust certain parameters of the program. The
current values for wf<x> (short of weight for x) make the program seem humanlike and funny so I kept them as is. There are however
better solutions but I'll let you figure them out. 
  
Basically what you want to do is add your own code such that you change those values in a way that attempts to improve your bestreward.

PS. If you want a challenge try to come up with a four variable equation such that it describes values that are good solutions for the 
weights.
