# W2_Homework

The following files contain my homework assignment for week 2 of the Move_37 course.
The course is free to others and found at: https://www.theschool.ai/


## File 'v020HwFrozenLakeKC.py'
I modified an existing OpenAi gym environment, FrozenLake-v0 for my own needs.
Minor changes dealing with rendering, fetching size of the map, and registering it as an id.
I would suggest using this is you are working from inside something like Visual Studio Code.

Oh and feel free to change the MAP!

## File 'v020HwAlg.py'
This file contains 'AI' algorithms.
The algorithm used is policy iteration.*
The other algorithm chooses the best action based on the value of each state.

I used https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/DP/
for help and as a basis for the algorithms.

## File 'v020Hw.py'
Is the file that puts it all together. And makes the agent play the game.
I hope that it is clear to follow and hope you guys play around with the map and
get a better idea of what is happening. 

Good luck to other fellow wizards and students!
